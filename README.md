1. **mini_batch_generator** creates small batches from the training data.
2. Each iteration of the loop yields a mini-batch, which can be used for training.

This mini-batch approach ensures that each iteration uses a smaller set of data, speeding up computations and allowing models to handle larger datasets by breaking them into smaller pieces.
